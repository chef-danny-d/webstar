# Reflection

When I initially read the task to create this application, it seemed extremely daunting since I have never used Angular before. I figured that I might as well push myself out of my comfort zone and try to translate all my React and overall JavaScript knowledge to get a solid understanding of the framework. After a while I recognized the patter that Angular uses as it is very similar to the one that [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) uses which I have years of experience working with.
